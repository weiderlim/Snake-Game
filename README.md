# Snake-Game

Just wanted to try and code the classic Snake Game with help from several online tutorials, to see how a game is created from
scratch. 

The Pygame module for Python 3 is needed to run this. WHEN RUNNING THIS GAME FROM THE TERMINAL MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING USING PYTHON VERSION 3 AND ABOVE (ex: python3 snake_game.py, if by default you are not running Python 3)

Added my own twist to it where the player can restart the game if they want to.

Pygame module for Python needed to run the game.

Enjoy!!
